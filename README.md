# Sponge-Poi
| A Minecraft plugin using SpongeAPI, for the (old) LunarCube Network.

This is a Minecraft plugin which uses [SpongePowered's](https://www.spongepowered.org/) API.

Made back in 2018-2019 sometime, Poi was completely custom made for only the LunarCube Network.
I have opened the source code to show the way I code and efficiency. I have full permission to publish this.

## Features

'Poi' has code for several 'base' areas. Which includes:
- [X] **BBHUD (BossBar-Heads-Up-Display)**: Displays text on the Boss/Title bar at the top of all players screens.
- [X] **AAnnouncements (Annoying Announcements)**: If Boss/Title Bars are not already annoying enough, this feature sends a message to the global chat every x seconds.
- [X] **ClearChat (Scuffed, but works.)**: Allows both clearing of local and global chat.
- [X] **Discord (IRC?)**: Shows a cool little 'Join our Discord' thingy in chat.
- [X] **AntiBorder (For Degens, By Degens.)**: Stops degenerates from exploiting outside the border causing server lag or crashes *COUGH COUGH*.
- [] **Mod Guard (Very helpful)**: Allows Poi to kick (or blacklist) players with certain mods from joining the server.
- [] **Sleep Vote (AKA "Sleep is for the weak!")**: Vote for day, for lazy bums.
- [] **Tab List (Very hot. Very functional.)**: Allows custom use of the TabList.
- [] **Giveaways (FREE STUFF?? I LOVE IT!)**: You can host giveaways with a random winner(s) to be selected.
- [] **Force Rules (!!!)**: Players HAVE to accept the rules in order to function. Can cause asphyxiation in those too slow.

* Some areas are not included, because this plugin originally was built as multiple. I will probably (not) get around to re-adding these later.
