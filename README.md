# Sponge-Poi
| A Minecraft plugin using SpongeAPI, for the (old) LunarCube Network.

This is a Minecraft plugin which uses [SpongePowered's](https://www.spongepowered.org/) API.

Made back in 2018-2019 sometime, Poi was completely custom made for only the LunarCube Network.
I have opened the source code to show the way I code and efficiency. I have full permission to publish this.

## Features

'Poi' has code for several 'base' areas. Which includes:
- [X] **BossBar Text**: Let's us use text at the top of the Player's screen for announcements & more information.
- Could be improved using changeable text/colors
- [X] **Announcements**: Let's us submit announcements to the Player's text chat every x amount of time.
- Work needs to be done on the reload function
- [X] **ClearChat Function**: Let's us clear the Player's text chat, globally or locally.
- [X] **Discord Function**: Let's us submit our Discord to the Player's text chat.
- [X] **Anti-Border-Fix**: Let's us prevent players using Ender Pearls or other methods to get out the border.
- [] **Sleep-Vote**: Let's players vote to sleep.
- [] **Tab List**: Let's us use a custom Tab List.
- [] **Giveaways**: Let's us host giveaways.
- [] **Rules Function**: Let's us force Player's to accept rules before playing.
